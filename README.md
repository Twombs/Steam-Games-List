An inputbox is displayed when the executable is run, asking for the Steam User ID.

That ID is stored for repeated use, in the 'Settings.ini' file.

If OK is clicked, then basic game data is downloaded from Steam, then shown in a basic GUI (previously a simple array GUI).

Or if CANCEL is clicked and data was downloaded previously, then it is shown in a basic GUI (previously a simple array GUI).

Previously an entry line could be copied by clicking the COPY button. Now each field has a button to copy text (Title or ID) or load the online link in your browser (URL or ICON). The URL can be either the Community game page or the Store game page, toggled by the 'Store' checkbox setting.

An XML file called 'Gameslist.xml' was downloaded to, containing the shown data and more.
