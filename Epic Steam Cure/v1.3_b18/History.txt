
(v1.1) When backing up to a ZIP or EXE file, a sub-folder is now created for it, using the game title. Two buttons have been added, NOTES and SAVE. The SAVE button downloads the game ICON file to the game destination folder, if it exists. The NOTES button creates a notes text file, containing DRM-Free List notes about the selected game, using the LIST name as title (i.e. Steam Fandom.txt). That file is saved to the game destination folder, if it exists.

(v1.2) Position of program window is now saved on exit and restored on startup. Added a SETUP button and window for 7-Zip options.

(v1.3) Program renamed to Epic Steam Cure, and some support added for owned Epic Games. UPDATE button has been added, and once a Steam ID has been provided that prompt at program start no longer appears. A query prompt to use Steam or Epic mode has been implemented at program start. Epic mode is not yet fully automated, requiring some manual interaction etc.

(v1.4) Support added for use of Legendary with Epic Games. Legendary however, is only 64 Bit unless you compile it yourself from source to 32 Bit, but you then get a 'Shared Memory' error when attempting to download a game. If using the 32 Bit version, the Legendary folder should be named to 'Legendary32', so that downloading is disabled. With the use of Legendary, owned game titles are returned from Epic, including DLC titles where applicable. NOTE - DLC names are added to the end of the main game title, as another entry, and this has mixed results for web page and game icon etc. Folder browsing has been improved. When Legendary use is enabled, appname (game ID) comes into play. INFO button added for saving Epic game detail to file. Steam game install can now be validated. The FIND (search) checkbox now has a third state, that allows direct search of the DRM-Free list file, for some specified title text, which is useful when titles don't match exactly. Console window stays open now after an Install or Download etc, to give feedback, and requires a key press to exit that paused state. Various minor game title and program improvements. Bugfix for game folder size when zipping. A different URL can be saved for a game, as well as an image URL, and one or both can be stored for a game using the FIX button. In 'Epic' mode an 'Install Options Etc' window is presented when clicking the 'INSTALL OPTIONS ...' button. You can now INSTALL, DOWNLOAD, VERIFY, UPDATE, REPAIR, UNINSTALL, LIST ALL INSTALLED etc, via that new window. Further improvements to DRM-Free title detection. Made a correction to zipping size determination, plus added support for '3 Gb' as a split option. Modified how 7-Zip gives feedback and a 'Zip Results' file is now shown (dependent on Logging Method in use). An improvement was made to get the correct time for when the selected 'Epic' process has finished. A different title can be saved for an Epic game, but will only be used for DRM-Free detection. Steam downloading has been improved, with similar logging to Epic. IMPORT game supported for Epic.
